# Database Index Performance Optimization

## Overview
This documentation covers the performance optimization process for the Airbnb-like database system through strategic index implementation. The `index_performance.md` file contains detailed analysis of query performance before and after adding database indexes.

## Contents

### 1. Index Implementation
- Lists all created indexes on Users, Properties, and Bookings tables
- Includes single-column and composite indexes
- Covers indexes for common query patterns

### 2. Performance Measurement
- Three representative test cases analyzed:
  - Property search queries
  - User booking history lookups
  - Host property performance reports
- Each case includes:
  - The SQL query being tested
  - Performance metrics (execution time, rows examined, planning time)
  - Before/after comparison tables

### 3. Key Findings
- Typical performance improvements of 90-97% across test cases
- Reduction in rows examined by 95-99%
- Consistent improvement in planning and execution times

### 4. Usage Instructions

To reproduce the performance tests:

1. Run the index creation statements from `database_index.sql`
2. Execute the test queries with `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`
3. Compare with baseline measurements taken before index implementation

Example:
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT p.* FROM properties p 
WHERE p.location = 'Paris' AND p.price < 200;
